# Knights and Rogues
Knights and Rogues is a two player, Snakes and Ladders-esque game with the end goal of reaching the top of the castle (game board).

## Rules
1. Choose which character you want to be (Knight or Rogue)
2. The Knight goes first
3. The player on their turn rolls the dice in the upper left corner of the screen
4. The player moves further into the castle by the number on the dice
5. If the player rolls a 6, they can roll the dice again
6. If the player lands on a pitfall, they fall down 3 floors or to the first floor if the player was originally less than 3 floors up
7. If the player lands on a cannon, they can manipulate the cannon to shoot them where they aim
8. If the player rolls more than the amount they need to reach the top, they back track the extra amount
9. A player wins when they reach the top of the castle
10. Points are calculated based on the number of turns it took to reach the top and the difference in positions between the winner and loser (for high score purposes)
